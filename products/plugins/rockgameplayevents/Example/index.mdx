#  Example Project

Please check out the Demonstration project at github:

:::info Tip

While this demonstration leverages 10 gameplay node actors. It would likely be better to write a custom gameplay node actor for your game's need.

However, there are use cases where one might only want to leverage existing functionality, and this is to demonstrate you can create more complex out of small building blocks of the Rock Gameplay Node Actors
