# Core Concepts and Usage

## How event system works


### RockDelegateConnectorComponent

This is what you will use to set up connections between actors.

This is mostly just a helper component, there should only ever be 1 per actor.
This component manages the input/output connections between actors.

See #Usage below for how to use.

### RockGameplayEventWorldSubsystem

The core of the system will bind the the appropriate functions and delegates 1 frame after BeginPlay. This subsystem is responsible for triggering these binds and then destroying the components.  

The destruction of components is purely a memory optimization as we no longer have a need for the actor components after binding. 

## Usage 


The core of the plugin utilizes RockDelegateConnector Component.

1. Attach it to any actor either instanced or as part of the base class.
2. In a placed instance actor with the component:
3. Add a new DelegateConnections array element using the +
4. Select any delegate on the parent actor. (e.g. `OnButtonEnabled` from the example project)
5. Add a new array element to this element
6. Select any placed target actor (e.g. BP_Fan)
7. Select a corresponding blueprint callable function on target actor.

:::info Tip
The available list of functions will be filtered to only corresponding delegate.
e.g. A delegate with 1 parameter (AActor*) can only be bound to functions that have a matching signature (i.e. also has 1 parameter of AActor*)
:::


An advanced setting is that AutoDestroyAfterBind:
There is no current functionality for the component to exist after beginplay.
So by default it destroys itself at this time.
