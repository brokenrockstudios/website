### Github Installation

2. Clone or download the repository
3. Copy the plugin folder to your project's Plugins directory

7. Restart your project and enjoy!

:::info Note
If your project is currently blueprint only, you need to add any C++ file via the editor to convert your BP project to a C++ supported one first.

### Requirements

* Unreal Engine 5.5 or later
  * There isn't anything in the plugin that would prevent earlier versions of UE5 that I am aware of. However you'd have to export/reimport a few image files to downgrade.
* C++ Project (Blueprint only projects require a few additional setup of using Github installation)
* Basic understanding of Unreal Engine's Delegate System (e.g. Multicast Events)



## Initial Setup

After enabling the plugin.

You can either try adding a Rock Gameplay Event Node Actor to the level or adding a Rock Gameplay Connector Component to any actor. Either an instanced actor in a level or to an existing actor.  The Plugin support both Blueprint and C++.
