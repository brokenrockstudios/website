# Power of 2 Blockout Toolkit

The <HL>Power of 2 Blockout Toolkit </HL> provides quality of life workflow improvements to worldbuilding prototypes or specific stylized gameplay.

# # Getting Started

There are 2 main features of the <HL>Power of 2: Blockout toolkit</HL>.

The <HL>Assets</HL> and the <HL>Editor Utility Widget</HL>.


The assets come in a few different variants.

The main building/architecture related <HL>Block</HL> pieces which inherit from <HL>AP2BTCellSnapActors</HL>. 
These pieces will snap to an absolute grid of <HL>512cm x 512cm x 384cm</HL>

## Sizes

### Why 512cm you might ask?  

* It's a power of 2
  * 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, <HL>512</HL>, 1024
* 512 can be represented perfectly in a texture
  * 512x512, 1024, 2048, 4096, etc..
* Allows enough size to represent a single room that still has enough room to have a few props or assets in it.
* It is enough size to accommodate most art styles and designs

### Why 384cm high?

* It's a combination of 2x power of 2s.
  * 256 + 128 = <HL>384cm</HL>
* It is flexible enough for a large variety of character sizes, including vehicles.
* It is flexible enough to accommodate for over shoulder third person cameras
* Having rectangular shaped walls look better than if this was 512cm tall.
* It's just high enough to have reasonable stairs within a single 512cm tile.

## Assets:


<HL>Blocks</HL> are Floors, Walls, Roofs, Shapes, Stairs, Columns, Balconies, and Misc. 

Raw Assets include a few additional assets in Props and Furniture, as well as the raw static mesh variants of the <HL>Blocks</HL>

All recommended assets usages have grid or solid color materials applied. 
If you are looking at the Content Browser and are seeing the standard UV colors, 
then there is likely a more appropriate asset to use instead. Such as a 
<HL>AP2BTCellSnapActors</HL> for the given piece.
