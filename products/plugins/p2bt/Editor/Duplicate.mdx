# Duplicate Tab



## Grid

Duplicates the selected actors into a grid. 


Example using multiple actors, x2, y2, z3 and offset 512x512x384 (standard cell size)

Example using Grid Packed, x5, y3, z1.
Will use bounding box of each item to pack it in.

## Line



Duplicates the selected actors into a line.
Note: Supports packing. Will use bounding boxes to attempt to be as compact as possible.


Example: Using quantity 5 withi offset (300,128,0).

## Circle

Duplicates the selected actors around the target actor in a circle. 

Note: Doesn't take into account original duplicated assets locations. 

Example: 

1. Select a target object, in this case S_Prop_Barrel_B2, with a quantity of 6 and 500 offset
2. Select the objects you want duplicated, in this case a barrel, crate, and pallet.
   * Optionally choose to delete original. 
3. Hit Create!

## Spline


Duplicates the selected actors along a spline.

1. Create a spline, use duplicate/extrude to add additional points to the spline.
   * Will automatically set Target Actor to created spline
2. Select a target spline if non are selected.
3. Select actors you wish to duplicate.
4. Duplicate!


Example:


1. Select an object in your viewport and Generate Spline.  
If no object is selected, the spline might end up at world origin [0,0,0]

2. Notice the created spline, in this case P2BT_SplineActor3  
If you already had a spline, while the spline is selected, choose "Select Target"

3. Using Alt and moving via the arrow transform will duplicate each node of the spline
    * manually rotate when necessary

4. Select actors, verify quantity and offset, and duplicate!

Note: Assuming you didn't delete it, the spline will auto-hide if unselected,
you can find via the outliner
