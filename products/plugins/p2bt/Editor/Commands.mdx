:::Info Tip
In the above case, the 2 red were from duplicated assets in the same location.
Because of this view, I could find and delete them



## Toggle Show

### Collision: Toggle collision's visibility

### Nav Mesh: Toggle nav mesh's visibility

:::info Tip
This is toggling between 'force show' and 'user selected'. 
This can sometimes cause some confusion, under Show in the viewport, you can see if it's user selected or try hitting UE default hotkey: `P`
